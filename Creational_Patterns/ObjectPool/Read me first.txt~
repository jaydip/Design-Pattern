** Intent
    -> Abstract Factory offers the interface for creating a family of related objects, without explicitly specifying their classes.

** Example
    AbstractProductA.pm is interface for creating Product A
    ProductA1.pm is a implementation of AbstractProductA.pm
    ProductA2.pm is a implementation of AbstractProductA.pm
    
    AbstractProductB.pm is interface for creating Product B
    ProductB1.pm is a implementation of AbstractProductB.pm
    ProductB2.pm is a implementation of AbstractProductB.pm
    
    AbstractFactory.pm is interface for creating factory
    ConcreteFactory1.pm is a implementation of AbstractFactory.pm
    inside ConcreteFactory1.pm use the ProductA1 & Product B1
    ConcreteFactory2.pm is a implementation of AbstractFactory.pm
    inside ConcreteFactory1.pm use the ProductA2 & Product B2

    FactoryMaker.pm is a class that decide in which factory production will be done.
    Client.pl is create object of FactoryMaker.pm and use that method
